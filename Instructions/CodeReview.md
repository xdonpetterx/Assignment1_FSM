Code Review
This assignment needs to be peer-reviewed by another student. After handing in your assignment, someone will review it. You should read and assess the feedback you get.

When reviewing code you should focus on the following areas:

Code style
Does it follow conventions? If not, is it reasonable?
Readability
Is the code understandable and usable by someone who has not written it?
Patterns and Architecture
Does it follow conventional design patterns, and if not, is it reasonably structured and understandable?
Does it employ anti-patterns that might degrade the codes quality over time?
Is the code structured in a good way? Can there be improvements?
Is the code bug-free?
Does the architecture make sense? Is there ways to improve it?
When writing your code review, make sure to

Explain your opinion
Provide examples to prove your points, if necessary
Only point out specific problems, not "I don't know why, but this is probably bad code"
Avoid blaming: It doesn't matter who wrote the code, only that the code gets improved afterwards
Be empathic
Be open for further discussions about the code
