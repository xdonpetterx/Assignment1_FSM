Reporting:
============================================
Everything should be handed in as a ZIP file here on Canvas.

- **Lab report**.
  A document that describes how you solved the problems and if you did something ingenious. Template for this can be found in Canvas. By reading this document, readers will gain an understanding of how you solved the problem and gain an understanding of why you structured the code as you did.


- **Code**.
  Make sure it is possible to compile on any computer. Add a readme file if necessary that describes any non-standard process for building the project.


- **Compiled code**, without external dependencies.
  This is usually a problem. If you use any external libraries (.dll files) they must be included in the code. An Installer usually solves most things, alternatively there are flags you can put in the compiler for this.
