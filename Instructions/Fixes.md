Messaging is working but needs to be improved:
============================================
- [ ] You should be able to meet in the store, when eating / drinking etc.
  - [x] For this to work all the locations need to be individual i.e. that the different agents can be in the same, or different locations
    - [ ] Different stats need to be implemented, now all agents are the same, make same amount of money, gets same fatigue so they do the same kind of things at the same time.
- [ ] The communication that the agents have between each other must take place in the form of a message, they all have access to a telephone with an SMS function.
- [ ] The dialogue between agents must be printed out and that a meeting is scheduled at a certain time and in a special place.
- [ ] Keep in mind that an agent can starve to death if he goes and meets friends instead of eating, if he needs to eat instead, let his friends know that he is not coming as agreed.
